## Third Space
Third Space was a start-up focused on creating communication and mentoring opportunities for employees within businesses. I conducted research that I used to inform visualizations of the core ideas driving the application and business model, then designed the first iteration of the application.

## Aha Notes
Aha Notes, a notebook and note taking app, was a personal project that I built with a team including an engineer, project manager, and marketing friends. It featured a patent pending physical notebook bound with a magnetic binding and a phone app that displayed a meaningful snippet of the note image as the list title.

## American Family Insurance Jutro Customization
American Family Insurance, a Fortune 300 company, was migrating to a single, centralized insurance API across multiple brands without also systematizing the UI. Utilizing and manipulating their own graphics, I demonstrated to upper management the need to take UI as seriously as backend development.  AmFam subsequently adopted a design system that mitigated this risk.

## Summit Next Generation UX
As an original member of Summit's newly implemented Design and Innovation Team, I initiated an exploration of what our various UI form factors could look like if we designed for our major use cases. This included a speculative usage map informing mobile, desktop, and in-branch experiences.

## Summit Loan Member Visualization
LOUI (Loan Object UI), a Summit Design and Innovation Team project that I lead, was intended to standardize the expression of a loan within Summit to visualize that loan across various contexts of the member's experience. This particular visualization was designed to augment an in-person conversation between a Loan Officer and a member.

## Summit Design System
I initiated, created, and maintain the Summit design system. It is built using Figma as the source of truth for tokens and Lit Elements. The design system is now used credit union wide and has greatly improved design quality and implementation efficiency.

## Figma Design System Widget
The Figma Design System widget is a next generation Figma widget taking design system tokenization and distribution to the next level. It allows for easy creation of all the various types of tokens, implicit documentation, ADA feedback, Font Awesome integration, and GitHub deployment (repo and npm packaging). It is going to be published in Q2 2023.

## Summit Content Platform
I took the lead to research alternatives to the CMS Summit uses to manage their website, which is reaching end of life this year.  I presented a content platform, Contentful, as an innovative solution to break out of the silo of CMS-based websites. Summit's CMO, CIO, and enthusiastically agreed to the solution I proposed I am now leading the website rebuild, including centralizing rates, branch locations, and all product information in Contentful so that it is accessible from all of Summit's digital service offerings. A  Contentful representative described the solution I have engineered as one of the most impressive presentations he had seen.

## Summit Rates Central
Summit Rates Central is a Contentful application that centralizes all rates and rate products. It transformed a 3 day process into less than an hour and sets the stage for complete automation of rate updates. It is built using Contentful, web components (Lit Elements), and React.
